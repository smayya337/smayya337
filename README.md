# Hi!

I'm Shreyas. I am currently a second-year at the University of Virginia majoring in computer science.
I enjoy cybersecurity, software engineering, systems administration, and everything in between.
Thanks for checking out my GitHub! Hopefully you'll find some of the stuff in here interesting.
